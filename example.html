	<h4 class='graybackground'> What is Open-Captions?</h4>
	According<a href="http://open-captions.com"></a> to <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1997.tb01597.x/abstract">research</a>, over 90% of deaf children have hearing parents who "frequently do not have fully effective means of communicating with them". The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_sign_language" title="American Sign Language">American Sign Language</a> (ASL) is a difficult language to learn, especially as a second language.

	<a href="http://open-captions.com" title="Open-Captions">Open-Captions</a> makes it easy for parents and children to learn and practice American Sign Language together while watching their favorite videos on YouTube. People can find closed captioned videos on any topic with the <a href="http://open-captions.com" title="Open-Captions">Open-Captions</a> search engine. The viewer is able to select individual words in the video's caption stream and see the American Sign Language representation of the word.

	Closed captions on various television shows have been around for quite some time. They are useful for hearing impaired people and also to people whose first language is not English.
	Captions have always been a steady stream of white text on black background, located either at the top or bottom of the screen. Video sites like <a href="http://youtube.com" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://hulu.com" title="Hulu">Hulu </a>, have adopted the same style from television.
	<a href="http://open-captions.com" title="Open-Captions">Open-Captions</a>, changes the way users watch videos by making the captions more interactive.
	<ul>
	<li>The viewer can pause the video, select a word and watch an ASL representation.</li>
	<li>The viewer can review earlier captions with the "Previous Caption" button.</li>
	</ul>
	The American Sign Language representations are shown from the <a href="http://cats.gatech.edu/mysignlink" title="SmartSign Dictionary">SmartSign </a>dictionary maintained by Georgia Institute of Technology's Center for Accessible Technology in Sign (<a href="http://cats.gatech.edu/">CATS</a>).

	<h4 class='graybackground'>How did Open-Captions come about?</h4>
	My interest in building Assistive Technologies has been one of the main motivating forces behind getting a graduate degree in Computer Science.

	I built a web based widget platform for Interactive TV as a graduate student researcher at GeorgiaTech. In the process I worked on developing functionality that would allow widget developers to access the closed captions associated with the currently playing content.
	<a href="http://cats.gatech.edu/content/harley-hamilton" title="Harley Hamilton">Harley Hamilton</a>, a researcher at CATS, was interested in leveraging this ability of accessing closed captions and we ended up building a <a href="http://vimeo.com/22262335" title="Chimpoo">rough prototype</a>. Subsequently, I learnt more about hearing impaired children from Harley and wrote a <a href="http://www.naduism.com/2011/04/15/asl-greasemonkey-script/" title="Greasemonkey Script for ASL">small tool</a> using which one can select any word on a webpage and see the American Sign Language representation of the word. This would be very useful for parents who want to learn ASL.
	In September this year, I signed up for the <a href="http://hackday.tv/" title="HackdayTV">HackdayTV </a> weekend hackathon and ended up building the first version of Open-Captions, which is the mashup of the earlier ideas I had worked on related to ASL.
